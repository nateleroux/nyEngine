nyEngine
========

shitty 3d engine with some lua threading integration

features 3D sounds, 3D rendering, nifty package files, and [blast processing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlulSyBI2aY)

there isn't really a license for this, if for some unholy reason you actually want to use this then contact me
